//Just adding that property that is enough to tell SwiftData that each destination has many sights associated with it. Our original model didn't have that relationship, but that's okay: the next time you run the app, SwiftData will silently upgrade its data store to take this change into account with no extra work from us. This is called a migration, and it allows us to upgrade and adjust our models over time.

//A cascade delete rule means "when we delete this object, delete all its sights too" â€“ exactly what we want
